/*
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
    - You have two arrays A and B. In one move, you can swap any element of A with any element of B.
    - Find the minimum possible value of max(A) - min(A) that you can attain.


EXPLANATION:
    - let C be an array of size 2n containing all the elements of A and B.
    - Let's sort C, so C1 <= C2 <= ... <= C2n

    - To minimize the difference, itâ€™s clearly optimal to choose N consecutive elements from this sorted C
    - That is, if the smallest element we pick is C[i], then it's optimal to pick the elements
      {Ci, Ci+1, Ci+2, ..., Cn+i-1}; giving us the difference of Cn+i-1 - Ci
      
    - There are n+1 choices for the smallest element: C1, C2, ..., Cn+1
