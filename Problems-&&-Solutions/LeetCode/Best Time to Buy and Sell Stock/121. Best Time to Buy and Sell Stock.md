# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Problem Statement: <https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/>   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Please note that whenever, it is mentioned as *a transaction*, it means that a combination of buy and sell.  

The idea is very simple  as only one transaction is allowed, if we sell a stock on $i^{th}$ day (*forward iteration*), we must know the minimum stock price in $[0,....,i-1]$. Here is the below code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int> &prices) {
        int min_stock_price = prices[0];
        int profit = 0;
        for(int i=1; i<(int)prices.size(); ++i) {
            profit = max(profit, prices[i] - min_stock_price);
            min_stock_price = min(min_stock_price, prices[i]);
        }
        return profit;
    }
};
```
Complexity:   
 - $TC \equiv O(n)$
 - $SC \equiv O(1)$
